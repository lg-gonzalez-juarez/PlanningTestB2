Ordinal numbers are often used in fractions:-

Fractions

1/8 	One eighth 	1/8
1/5 	One fifth 	
1/4 	One quarter	 1/4

Symbols 	Word (common term in brackets) 	Pronounce It
+ 	Plus (And) 	+
- 	Minus (Take away) 	-
x 	Multiplied by (Times) 	x
÷ 	Divided by 	÷
= 	Equals (Is) 	=
. 	Point 	.
% 	Percent 	%
(((1 + 6) - 2) x 2) ÷ 2.5=4 	
One plus six minus two multiplied by two divided by two point five equals four
or One and six take away two times two divided by two point five is four
	1 + 6 - 2 x 2 ÷ 2.5=4
10% 100=10 	Ten percent of one hundred equals ten. 	10% 100=10


What to say

We often say "a" instead of "one".
For example when we have the numbers 100 or 1/2 we say "A hundred" or "A half".

For example:
11/2 - "One and a half."
When pronouncing decimals we use the word point to represent the dot. The numbers following the dot are pronounced separately.

For example:

When you have the number 1.36 we say "One point three six."

 
Interesting Numbers

~ 0 ~

What could possibly be interesting about nothing?

Try writing the numbers zero ( 0 ) through nine ( 9 ).

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Then write how many numbers you have counted:-

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Yes, ten numbers, without using the number 10.

You can put as many noughts in front of a number without changing the value of that number:-

01, 002, 0003, 00004 ...

In English 10, 20, 30, through to 90 are 1 ten, 2 tens, 3 tens, etc.

Also there are a number of ways you can say 0 in English.

   	When we use it  		For example:-
0 = oh 	after a decimal point 		9.02 = "Nine point oh two."
  	in bus or room numbers 	Rooom 101 = "Room one oh one."
Bus 602 = "Bus six oh two."
  	in phone numbers 		9130472 = "Nine one three oh four seven two."
  	in years 				1906 = "Nineteen oh six."
0 = nought 	before a decimal point 	0.06 = "Nought point oh six."
0 = zero 	in temperature 		-10°C = "10 degrees below zero."
  	US English for the number 	0 = "Zero"
0 = nil 	in football 		Chelsea 2 Manchester United 0 = "Chelsea two Manchester United nil."
0 = love 	in tennis 			20 - 0 = "Twenty love."

~ 12 ~

The number 12 is often represented as a dozen and the number 6 as a half dozen.

For example:
12 eggs= "A dozen eggs."
6 eggs = "Half a dozen eggs."
 
~ 13 ~

A dozen is 12, but a baker's dozen is 13, because in the past bakers who were caught shortchanging customers could be liable to severe punishment, so they used to add an extra bread roll to make up the weight.
 
~ 100 ~

A century is 100. The roman numeral for 100 is C, for centum.

One hundred is the basis of percentages (literally "per hundred"). 100% is the full amount of something.
 
~ 1 billion ~

When is a billion not a billion?

In British English billion traditionally means a million million = 1,000,000,000,000 = 1012

In American English billion means a thousand million = 1,000,000,000 = 109

The American billion has become standard in technical and financial use.

However, to avoid confusion it is better to use the terms "thousand million" for 109 and "million million" for 1012.

Milliard " is French for the number 109. It is not used in American English but is sometimes, but rarely, used in British English.
Letters as Numbers
~ k ~

The letter k is often used to denote a thousand. So, 1k = 1,000.

If you see a job advertised and it offers a salary of £12k it means £12,000.00.
 
~ m ~

The letter m is often used to denote a million. So, 1m = 1,000,000.

If you see a job advertised and it offers a salary of £12m, apply for it!
 
~ bn ~

The letters bn denote a billion. So, 1bn is usually 1,000,000,000 (see above).

If you see a job advertised and it offers a salary of £12bn, it's probably a missprint.
myriad

The word myriad used to mean 10,000. Nowadays it's used to refer to a countless number or multitude of specified things.

For example: Earth hosts a myriad of animals.
