### USE 1 Repeated Actions.
![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepresentusual.gif)

Use the Simple Present to express the idea that an action is repeated or usual. The action can be a habit, a hobby, a daily event, a scheduled event or something that often happens. It can also be something a person often forgets or usually does not do. Examples:

* I **play** tennis.
* She **does not play** tennis.
* **Does** he **play** tennis?
* The train **leaves** every morning at 8 AM.
* The train **does not leave** at 9 AM.
* When **does** the train usually **leave**?
* She always **forgets** her purse.
* He never **forgets** his wallet.
* Every twelve months, the Earth **circles** the Sun.
* **Does** the Sun **circle** the Earth?

### USE 2 Facts or Generalizations
![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepresentfact.gif)

The Simple Present can also indicate the speaker believes that a fact was true before, is true now, and will be true in the future. It is not important if the speaker is correct about the fact. It is also used to make generalizations about people or things. Examples:

* Cats **like** milk.
* Birds **do not like** milk.
* **Do** pigs **like** milk?
* California **is** in America.
* California **is not** in the United Kingdom.
* Windows **are** made of glass.
* Windows **are not** made of wood.
* New York **is** a small city. It is not important that this fact is untrue.

### USE 3 Scheduled Events in the Near Future
![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplefuture.gif)

Speakers occasionally use Simple Present to talk about scheduled events in the near future. This is most commonly done when talking about public transportation, but it can be used with other scheduled events as well. Examples:

* The train **leaves** tonight at 6 PM.
* The bus **does not arrive** at 11 AM, it **arrives** at 11 PM.
* When **do** we **board** the plane?
* The party **starts** at 8 o'clock.
* When **does** class **begin** tomorrow?

### USE 4 Now (Non-Continuous Verbs)
![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/presentcontinuousnow.gif)

Speakers sometimes use the Simple Present to express the idea that an action is happening or is not happening now. This can only be done with Non-Continuous Verbs and certain Mixed Verbs.

Examples:

* I **am** here now.
* She **is not** here now.
* He **needs** help right now.
* He **does not need** help now.
* He **has** his passport in his hand.
* **Do** you **have** your passport with you?

## FORM: am/is/are + present participle

Examples:

### USE 1 Now
![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/presentcontinuousnow.gif)

Use the Present Continuous with Normal Verbs to express the idea that something is happening now, at this very moment. It can also be used to show that something is not happening now.

Examples:

* You **are learning** English now.
* You **are not swimming** now.
* **Are** you **sleeping**?
* I **am sitting**.
* I **am not standing**.
* Is **he sitting** or **standing**?
* They **are reading** their books.
* They **are not watching** television.
* What **are** you **doing**?
* Why **aren't** you **doing** your homework?

### USE 2 Longer Actions in Progress Now

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/presentcontinuouslongnow.gif)

In English, "now" can mean: this second, today, this month, this year, this century, and so on. Sometimes, we use the Present Continuous to say that we are in the process of doing a longer action which is in progress; however, we might not be doing it at this exact second.

Examples: (All of these sentences can be said while eating dinner in a restaurant.)

* I **am studying** to become a doctor.
* I **am not studying** to become a dentist.
* I **am reading** the book Tom Sawyer.
* I **am not reading** any books right now.
* **Are** you **working** on any special projects at work?
* **Aren't** you **teaching** at the university now?

### USE 3 Near Future

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplefuture.gif)

Sometimes, speakers use the Present Continuous to indicate that something will or will not happen in the near future.

Examples:

* I **am meeting** some friends after work.
* I **am not going** to the party tonight.
* **Is** he **visiting** his parents next weekend?
* **Isn't** he **coming** with us tonight?

### USE 4 Repetition and Irritation with "Always"

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepresentusual.gif)

The Present Continuous with words such as "always" or "constantly" expresses the idea that something irritating or shocking often happens. Notice that the meaning is like Simple Present, but with negative emotion. Remember to put the words "always" or "constantly" between "be" and "verb+ing."

Examples:

* She **is always** coming to class late.
* He **is** **constantly** **talking**. I wish he would shut up.
* I don't like them because they **are always complaining**.

**REMEMBER Non-Continuous Verbs/ Mixed Verbs**

It is important to remember that Non-Continuous Verbs cannot be used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for Mixed Verbs cannot be used in continuous tenses. Instead of using Present Continuous with these verbs, you must use Simple Present.

Examples:

* ~~She **is loving** this chocolate ice cream~~. Not Correct
* She **loves** this chocolate ice cream. Correct

### ADVERB PLACEMENT

The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.

Examples:

* You are **still watching** TV.
* Are you **still watching** TV?

Examples:

* Right now, Tom **is writing** the letter. Active
* Right now, the letter **is being written** by Tom. Passive

## FORM: has/have + past participle

**FORM: \[has/have + past participle]**

Examples:

* You **have seen** that movie many times.
* **Have you seen** that movie many times?
* **You have not seen** that movie many times.

### USE 1 Unspecified Time Before Now

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/presentperfect.gif)

We use the Present Perfect to say that an action happened at an unspecified time before now. The exact time is not important. You CANNOT use the Present Perfect with specific time expressions such as: yesterday, one year ago, last week, when I was a child, when I lived in Japan, at that moment, that day, one day, etc. We CAN use the Present Perfect with unspecific expressions such as: ever, never, once, many times, several times, before, so far, already, yet, etc.

Examples:

I **have seen** that movie twenty times.

I think I **have met** him once before.

There **have been** many earthquakes in California.

People **have traveled** to the Moon.

People **have not traveled** to Mars.

**Have** you **read** the book yet?

Nobody **has** ever **climbed** that mountain.

A:**Has** there ever **been** a war in the United States?

B: Yes, there **has been** a war in the United States.

### How Do You Actually Use the Present Perfect?

The concept of "unspecified time" can be very confusing to English learners. It is best to associate Present Perfect with the following topics:

### TOPIC 1 Experience

You can use the Present Perfect to describe your experience. It is like saying, "I have the experience of..." You can also use this tense to say that you have never had a certain experience. The Present Perfect is NOT used to describe a specific event.

Examples:

*   I **have been** to France.

    _This sentence means that you have had the experience of being in France. Maybe you have been there once, or several times._
*   I **have been** to France three times.

    _You can add the number of times at the end of the sentence._
*   I **have** never **been** to France.

    _This sentence means that you have not had the experience of going to France._
* I think I **have seen** that movie before.
* He **has** never **traveled** by train.
* Joan **has studied** two foreign languages.
*   A:**Have** you ever **met** him?

    B: No, I **have** not **met** him.

### TOPIC 2 Change Over Time

We often use the Present Perfect to talk about change that has happened over a period of time.

Examples:

* You **have grown** since the last time I saw you.
* The government **has become** more interested in arts education.
* Japanese **has become** one of the most popular courses at the university since the Asian studies program was established.
* My English **has** really **improved** since I moved to Australia.

### TOPIC 3 Accomplishments

We often use the Present Perfect to list the accomplishments of individuals and humanity. You cannot mention a specific time.

Examples:

* Man **has walked** on the Moon.
* Our son **has learned** how to read.
* Doctors **have cured** many deadly diseases.
* Scientists **have split** the atom.

### TOPIC 4 An Uncompleted Action You Are Expecting

We often use the Present Perfect to say that an action which we expected has not happened. Using the Present Perfect suggests that we are still waiting for the action to happen.

Examples:

* James **has not finished** his homework yet.
* Susan **hasn't mastered** Japanese, but she can communicate.
* Bill **has** still **not arrived**.
*   The rain **hasn't stopped**

    .

### TOPIC 5 Multiple Actions at Different Times

We also use the Present Perfect to talk about several different actions which have occurred in the past at different times. Present Perfect suggests the process is not complete and more actions are possible.

Examples:

* The army **has attacked** that city five times.
* I **have had** four quizzes and five tests so far this semester.
* We **have had** many major problems while working on this project.
* She **has talked** to several specialists about her problem, but nobody knows why she is sick.

### Time Expressions with Present Perfect

When we use the Present Perfect it means that something has happened at some point in our lives before now. Remember, the exact time the action happened is not important.

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/presentperfect.gif)

Sometimes, we want to limit the time we are looking in for an experience. We can do this with expressions such as: in the last week, in the last year, this week, this month, so far, up to now, etc.

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/presentperfectlimit.gif)

Examples:

* **Have** you **been** to Mexico **in the last year**?
* I **have seen** that movie six times **in the last month**.
* They **have had** three tests **in the last week**.
* She graduated from university less than three years ago. She **has worked** for three different companies **so far**.
*   My car **has broken** down three times **this week**

    .

#### NOTICE

"Last year" and "in the last year" are very different in meaning. "Last year" means the year before now, and it is considered a specific time which requires [Simple Past](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplepast.html). "In the last year" means from 365 days ago until now. It is not considered a specific time, so it requires Present Perfect.

Examples:

* I **went** to Mexico **last year**\
  ._I went to Mexico in the calendar year before this one._
* I **have been** to Mexico **in the last year**\
  ._I have been to Mexico at least once at some point between 365 days ago and now._

### USE 2 Duration From the Past Until Now (Non-Continuous Verbs)

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/presentperfectcontinuous.gif)

With [Non-Continuous Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html) and non-continuous uses of [Mixed Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html), we use the Present Perfect to show that something started in the past and has continued up until now. "For five minutes," "for two weeks," and "since Tuesday" are all durations which can be used with the Present Perfect.

Examples:

* I **have had** a cold for two weeks.
* She **has been** in England for six months.
* Mary **has loved** chocolate since she was a little girl.

Although the above use of Present Perfect is normally limited to Non-Continuous Verbs and non-continuous uses of Mixed Verbs, the words "live," "work," "teach," and "study" are sometimes used in this way even though they are NOT Non-Continuous Verbs.

### ADVERB PLACEMENT

The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.

Examples:

* You have **only** seen that movie one time.
* Have you **only** seen that movie one time?

### ACTIVE / PASSIVE

Examples:

* Many tourists **have visited** that castle. _Active_
* That castle **has been visited** by many tourists. _Passive_

## FORM: has/have + been + present participle

**FORM: \[has/have + been + present participle]**

Examples:

* You **have been waiting** here for two hours.
* **Have** you **been waiting** here for two hours?
* You **have not been waiting** here for two hours.

### USE 1 Duration from the Past Until Now

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/presentperfectcontinuous.gif)

We use the Present Perfect Continuous to show that something started in the past and has continued up until now. "For five minutes," "for two weeks," and "since Tuesday" are all durations which can be used with the Present Perfect Continuous.

Examples:

* They **have been talking** for the last hour.
* She **has been working** at that company for three years.
* What **have** you **been doing** for the last 30 minutes?
* James **has been teaching** at the university since June.
* We **have been waiting** here for over two hours!
* Why **has** Nancy **not been taking** her medicine for the last three days?

### USE 2 Recently, Lately

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/presentperfectcontinuous.gif)

You can also use the Present Perfect Continuous WITHOUT a duration such as "for two weeks." Without the duration, the tense has a more general meaning of "lately." We often use the words "lately" or "recently" to emphasize this meaning.

Examples:

* Recently, I **have been feeling** really tired.
* She **has been watching** too much television lately.
* **Have** you **been exercising** lately?
* Mary **has been feeling** a little depressed.
* Lisa **has not been practicing** her English.
* What **have** you **been doing**?

### IMPORTANT

Remember that the Present Perfect Continuous has the meaning of "lately" or "recently." If you use the Present Perfect Continuous in a question such as "Have you been feeling alright?", it can suggest that the person looks sick or unhealthy. A question such as "Have you been smoking?" can suggest that you smell the smoke on the person. Using this tense in a question suggests you can see, smell, hear or feel the results of the action. It is possible to insult someone by using this tense incorrectly.

### REMEMBER Non-Continuous Verbs/ Mixed Verbs

It is important to remember that [Non-Continuous Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html) cannot be used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for [Mixed Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html) cannot be used in continuous tenses. Instead of using Present Perfect Continuous with these verbs, you must use [Present Perfect](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/presentperfect.html).

Examples:

* Sam **has been having** his car for two years. _Not Correct_
* Sam **has had** his car for two years. _Correct_

### ADVERB PLACEMENT

The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.

Examples:

* You have **only** been waiting here for one hour.
* Have you **only** been waiting here for one hour?

### ACTIVE / PASSIVE

Examples:

* Recently, John **has been doing** the work. _Active_
* Recently, the work **has been being done** by John. _Passive_

NOTE: Present Perfect Continuous is less commonly used in its passive form.
