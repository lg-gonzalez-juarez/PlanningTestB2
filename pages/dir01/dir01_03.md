# SECTION C1

Simple Future has two different forms in English: "will" and "be going to." Although the two forms can sometimes be used interchangeably, they often express two very different meanings. These different meanings might seem too abstract at first, but with time and practice, the differences will become clear. Both "will" and "be going to" refer to a specific time in the future.

## FORM Will: \[will + verb]

Examples:

* You **will help** him later.
* **Will** you **help** him later?
* You **will not help** him later.

## FORM Be Going To: \[am/is/are + going to + verb]

Examples:

* You **are going to meet** Jane tonight.
* **Are** you **going to meet** Jane tonight?
* You **are not going to meet** Jane tonight.

## USE 1 "Will" to Express a Voluntary Action

"Will" often suggests that a speaker will do something voluntarily. A voluntary action is one the speaker offers to do for someone else. Often, we use "will" to respond to someone else's complaint or request for help. We also use "will" when we request that someone help us or volunteer to do something for us. Similarly, we use "will not" or "won't" when we refuse to voluntarily do something.

Examples:

* I **will send** you the information when I get it.
* I **will translate** the email, so Mr. Smith can read it.
* **Will** you **help** me move this heavy table?
* **Will** you **make** dinner?
* I **will not do** your homework for you.
* I **won't do** all the housework myself!
* A: I'm really hungry. B: I**'ll make** some sandwiches.
* A: I'm so tired. I'm about to fall asleep. B: I**'ll get** you some coffee.
* A: The phone is ringing. B: I**'ll get** it.

## USE 2 "Will" to Express a Promise

"Will" is usually used in promises.

Examples:

* I **will call** you when I arrive.
* If I am elected President of the United States, I **will make** sure everyone has access to inexpensive health insurance.
* I promise I **will not tell** him about the surprise party.
* Don't worry, I**'ll be** careful.
* I **won't tell** anyone your secret.

## USE 3 "Be going to" to Express a Plan

"Be going to" expresses that something is a plan. It expresses the idea that a person intends to do something in the future. It does not matter whether the plan is realistic or not.

Examples:

* He **is going to spend** his vacation in Hawaii.
* She **is not going to spend** her vacation in Hawaii.
* A: When **are** we **going to meet** each other tonight? B: We **are going to meet** at 6 PM.
* I**'m going to be** an actor when I grow up.
* Michelle **is going to begin** medical school next year.
* They **are going to drive** all the way to Alaska.
* Who **are** you **going to invite** to the party?
* A: Who **is going to make** John's birthday cake?   B: Sue **is going to make** John's birthday cake.

## USE 4 "Will" or "Be Going to" to Express a Prediction

Both "will" and "be going to" can express the idea of a general prediction about the future. Predictions are guesses about what might happen in the future. In "prediction" sentences, the subject usually has little control over the future and therefore USES 1-3 do not apply. In the following examples, there is no difference in meaning.

Examples:

* The year 2222 **will be** a very interesting year.
* The year 2222 **is going to be** a very interesting year.
* John Smith **will be** the next President.
* John Smith **is going to be** the next President.
* The movie "Zenith" **will win** several Academy Awards.
* The movie "Zenith" **is going to win** several Academy Awards.

## IMPORTANT

In the Simple Future, it is not always clear which USE the speaker has in mind. Often, there is more than one way to interpret a sentence's meaning.

## No Future in Time Clauses

Like all future forms, the Simple Future cannot be used in clauses beginning with time expressions such as: when, while, before, after, by the time, as soon as, if, unless, etc. Instead of Simple Future, [Simple Present](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplepresent.html) is used.

Examples:

* When you **will arrive** tonight, we will go out for dinner. _Not Correct_
* When you **arrive** tonight, we will go out for dinner. _Correct_

## ADVERB PLACEMENT

The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.

Examples:

* You will **never** help him.
* Will you **ever** help him?
* You are **never** going to meet Jane.
* Are you **ever** going to meet Jane?

## ACTIVE / PASSIVE

Examples:

* John **will finish** the work by 5:00 PM. _Active_
* The work **will be finished** by 5:00 PM. _Passive_
* Sally **is going to make** a beautiful dinner tonight. _Active_
* A beautiful dinner **is going to be made** by Sally tonight. _Passive_


# SECTION C2


Future Perfect has two different forms: "will have done" and "be going to have done." Unlike [Simple Future](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplefuture.html) forms, Future Perfect forms are usually interchangeable.

## FORM Future Perfect with "Will" \[will have + past participle]

Examples:

* You **will have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.
* **Will** you **have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.?
* You **will not have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.

## FORM Future Perfect with "Be Going To" \[am/is/are + going to have + past participle]

Examples:

* You **are going to have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.
* **Are** you **going to have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.?
* You **are not going to have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.

NOTE: It is possible to use either "will" or "be going to" to create the Future Perfect with little or no difference in meaning.

## USE 1 Completed Action Before Something in the Future

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/futureperfect.gif)

The Future Perfect expresses the idea that something will occur before another action in the future. It can also show that something will happen before a specific time in the future.

Examples:

* By next November, I **will have received** my promotion.
* By the time he _gets_ home, she **is going to have cleaned** the entire house.
* I **am not going to have finished** this test by 3 o'clock.
* **Will** she **have learned** enough Chinese to communicate before she _moves_ to Beijing?
* Sam **is** probably **going to have completed** the proposal by the time he _leaves_ this afternoon.
* By the time I _finish_ this course, I **will have taken** ten tests.
* How many countries **are** you **going to have visited** by the time you _turn_ 50?

Notice in the examples above that the reference points (_marked in italics_) are in [Simple Present](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplepresent.html) rather than [Simple Future](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplefuture.html). This is because the interruptions are in [time clauses](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplefuture.html#tc), and you cannot use future tenses in time clauses.

## USE 2 Duration Before Something in the Future (Non-Continuous Verbs)

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/futureperfectcontinuous.gif)

With [Non-Continuous Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html) and some non-continuous uses of [Mixed Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html), we use the Future Perfect to show that something will continue up until another action in the future.

Examples:

* I **will have been** in London for six months by the time I leave.
* By Monday, Susan **is going to have had** my book for a week.

Although the above use of Future Perfect is normally limited to Non-Continuous Verbs and non-continuous uses of Mixed Verbs, the words "live," "work," "teach," and "study" are sometimes used in this way even though they are NOT Non-Continuous Verbs.

## REMEMBER No Future in Time Clauses

Like all future forms, the Future Perfect cannot be used in clauses beginning with time expressions such as: when, while, before, after, by the time, as soon as, if, unless, etc. Instead of Future Perfect, [Present Perfect](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/presentperfect.html) is used.

Examples:

* I am going to see a movie when I **will have finished** my homework. _Not Correct_
* I am going to see a movie when I **have finished** my homework._Correct_

## ADVERB PLACEMENT

The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.

Examples:

* You will **only** have learned a few words.
* Will you **only** have learned a few words?
* You are **only** going to have learned a few words.
* Are you **only** going to have learned a few words?

## ACTIVE / PASSIVE

Examples:

* They **will have completed** the project before the deadline. _Active_
* The project **will have been completed** before the deadline._Passive_
* They **are going to have completed** the project before the deadline._Active_
* The project **is going to have been completed** before the deadline. _Passive_

Examples:

* You **will have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.
* **Will** you **have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.?
* You **will not have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.

## FORM Future Perfect with "Be Going To" \[am/is/are + going to have + past participle]

Examples:

* You **are going to have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.
* **Are** you **going to have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.?
* You **are not going to have perfected** your English by the time you come back from the U.S.

# SECTION C4

Future Perfect Continuous has two different forms: "will have been doing " and "be going to have been doing." Unlike [Simple Future](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplefuture.html) forms, Future Perfect Continuous forms are usually interchangeable.

## FORM Future Perfect Continuous with "Will"

**\[will have been + present participle]**

Examples:

* You **will have been waiting** for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives.
* **Will** you **have been waiting** for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives?
* You **will not have been waiting** for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives.

## FORM Future Perfect Continuous with "Be Going To"

**\[am/is/are + going to have been + present participle]**

Examples:

* You **are going to have been waiting** for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives.
* **Are** you **going to have been waiting** for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives?
* You **are not going to have been waiting** for more than two hours when her plane finally arrives.

NOTE: It is possible to use either "will" or "be going to" to create the Future Perfect Continuous with little or no difference in meaning.

## USE 1 Duration Before Something in the Future

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/futureperfectcontinuous.gif)

We use the Future Perfect Continuous to show that something will continue up until a particular event or time in the future. "For five minutes," "for two weeks," and "since Friday" are all durations which can be used with the Future Perfect Continuous. Notice that this is related to the [Present Perfect Continuous](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/presentperfectcontinuous.html) and the [Past Perfect Continuous](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/pastperfectcontinuous.html); however, with Future Perfect Continuous, the duration stops at or before a reference point in the future.

Examples:

* They **will have been talking** for over an hour by the time Thomas _arrives_.
* She **is going to have been working** at that company for three years when it finally _closes_.
* James **will have been teaching** at the university for more than a year by the time he _leaves_ for Asia.
* How long **will** you **have been studying** when you _graduate_?
* We **are going to have been driving** for over three days straight when we _get_ to Anchorage.
* A: When you _finish_ your English course, **will** you **have been living** in New Zealand for over a year?  B: No, I **will not have been living** here that long.

Notice in the examples above that the reference points (_marked in italics_) are in [Simple Present](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplepresent.html) rather than [Simple Future](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplefuture.html). This is because these future events are in [time clauses](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplefuture.html#tc), and you cannot use future tenses in time clauses.

## USE 2 Cause of Something in the Future

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/futureperfectcontinuous.gif)

Using the Future Perfect Continuous before another action in the future is a good way to show cause and effect.

Examples:

* Jason will be tired when he gets home because he **will have been jogging** for over an hour.
*   Claudia's English will be perfect when she returns to Germany because she **is going to have been studying**

    &#x20;English in the United States for over two years.

## Future Continuous vs. Future Perfect Continuous

If you do not include a duration such as "for five minutes," "for two weeks" or "since Friday," many English speakers choose to use the Future Continuous rather than the Future Perfect Continuous. Be careful because this can change the meaning of the sentence. Future Continuous emphasizes interrupted actions, whereas Future Perfect Continuous emphasizes a duration of time before something in the future. Study the examples below to understand the difference.

Examples:

*   He will be tired because he **will be exercising** so hard.

    _This sentence emphasizes that he will be tired because he will be exercising at that exact moment in the future._
*   He will be tired because he **will have been exercising** so hard.

    _This sentence emphasizes that he will be tired because he will have been exercising for a period of time. It is possible that he will still be exercising at that moment OR that he will just have finished._

## REMEMBER No Future in Time Clauses

Like all future forms, the Future Perfect Continuous cannot be used in clauses beginning with time expressions such as: when, while, before, after, by the time, as soon as, if, unless, etc. Instead of Future Perfect Continuous, [Present Perfect Continuous](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/presentperfectcontinuous.html) is used.

Examples:

* You won't get a promotion until you **will have been working** here as long as Tim. _Not Correct_
* You won't get a promotion until you **have been working** here as long as Tim. _Correct_

## AND REMEMBER Non-Continuous Verbs / Mixed Verbs

It is important to remember that [Non-Continuous Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html) cannot be used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for [Mixed Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html) cannot be used in continuous tenses. Instead of using Future Perfect Continuous with these verbs, you must use [Future Perfect](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/futureperfect.html) .

Examples:

* Ned **will have been having** his driver's license for over two years. _Not Correct_
* Ned **will have had** his driver's license for over two years._Correct_

## ADVERB PLACEMENT

The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.

Examples:

* You will **only** have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives.
* Will you **only** have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives?
* You are **only** going to have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives.
* Are you **only** going to have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives?

## ACTIVE / PASSIVE

Examples:

* The famous artist **will have been painting** the mural for over six months by the time it is finished. _Active_
* The mural **will have been being painted** by the famous artist for over six months by the time it is finished. _Passive_
* The famous artist **is going to have been painting** the mural for over six months by the time it is finished. _Active_
* The mural **is going to have been being painted** by the famous artist for over six months by the time it is finished. _Passive_

NOTE: Passive forms of the Future Perfect Continuous are not common.
