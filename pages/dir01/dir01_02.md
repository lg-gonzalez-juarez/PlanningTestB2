# SECTION B1

## Simple Past

**FORM: \[VERB+ed] or** [**irregular verbs**](http://www.englishpage.com/irregularverbs/irregularverbs.html)

Examples:

* You **called** Debbie.
* **Did** you **call** Debbie?
* You **did not call** Debbie.

**Most Verbs.** Most verbs conjugate by adding _-ed_ like the verb "wait" below.

## USE 1 Completed Action in the Past

![diagram](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepast.gif)

Use the Simple Past to express the idea that an action started and finished at a specific time in the past. Sometimes, the speaker may not actually mention the specific time, but they do have one specific time in mind.

Examples:

* I **saw** a movie yesterday.
* I **didn't see** a play yesterday.
* Last year, I **traveled** to Japan.
* Last year, I **didn't travel** to Korea.
* **Did** you **have** dinner last night?
* She **washed** her car.
* He **didn't wash** his car.

## USE 2 A Series of Completed Actions

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepastseries.gif)

We use the Simple Past to list a series of completed actions in the past. These actions happen 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and so on.

Examples:

* I **finished** work, **walked** to the beach, and **found** a nice place to swim.
*   He **arrived** from the airport at 8:00, **checked** into the hotel at 9:00, and&#x20;

    **met** the others at 10:00.
* **Did** you **add** flour, **pour** in the milk, and then **add** the eggs?

## USE 3 Duration in Past

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepastduration.gif)

The Simple Past can be used with a duration which starts and stops in the past. A duration is a longer action often indicated by expressions such as: for two years, for five minutes, all day, all year, etc.

Examples:

* I **lived** in Brazil for two years.
* Shauna **studied** Japanese for five years.
* They **sat** at the beach all day.
* They **did not stay** at the party the entire time.
* We **talked** on the phone for thirty minutes.
* A: How long **did** you **wait** for them? B: We **waited** for one hour.

## USE 4 Habits in the Past
![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepasthabit.gif)

The Simple Past can also be used to describe a habit which stopped in the past. It can have the same meaning as "[used to](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/usedto.html)." To make it clear that we are talking about a habit, we often add expressions such as: always, often, usually, never, when I was a child, when I was younger, etc.

Examples:

* I **studied** French when I was a child.
* He **played** the violin.
* He **didn't play** the piano.
* **Did** you **play** a musical instrument when you were a kid?
* She **worked** at the movie theater after school.
* They never **went** to school, they always **skipped** class.

## USE 5 Past Facts or Generalizations
![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepastfact.gif)

The Simple Past can also be used to describe past facts or generalizations which are no longer true. As in USE 4 above, this use of the Simple Past is quite similar to the expression "[used to](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/usedto.html)."

Examples:

* She **was** shy as a child, but now she is very outgoing.
* He **didn't like** tomatoes before.
* **Did** you **live** in Texas when you **were** a kid?
* People **paid** much more to make cell phone calls in the past.

## IMPORTANT When-Clauses Happen First

Clauses are groups of words which have meaning but are often not complete sentences. Some clauses begin with the word "when" such as "when I dropped my pen..." or "when class began..." These clauses are called when-clauses, and they are very important. The examples below contain when-clauses.

Examples:

* **When I paid her one dollar**, she answered my question.
*   She answered my question **when I paid her one dollar**

    .

When-clauses are important because they always happen first when both clauses are in the Simple Past. Both of the examples above mean the same thing: first, I paid her one dollar, and then, she answered my question. It is not important whether "when I paid her one dollar" is at the beginning of the sentence or at the end of the sentence. However, the example below has a different meaning. First, she answered my question, and then, I paid her one dollar.

Example:

*   I paid her one dollar **when she answered my question**

    **ADVERB PLACEMENT**

The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.

Examples:

* You **just** called Debbie.
* Did you **just** call Debbie?

## ACTIVE / PASSIVE

Examples:

* Tom **repaired** the car. _Active_
* The car **was repaired** by Tom. _Passive_

# SECTION B2

**FORM: \[was/were + present participle]**

Examples:

* You **were studying** when she called.
* **Were** you **studying** when she called?
* You **were not studying** when she called.

## USE 1 Interrupted Action in the Past

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/pastcontinuous.gif)

Use the Past Continuous to indicate that a longer action in the past was interrupted. The interruption is usually a shorter action in the Simple Past. Remember this can be a real interruption or just an interruption in time.

Examples:

* I **was watching** TV when she called.
* When the phone rang, she **was writing** a letter.
* While we **were having** the picnic, it started to rain.
* What **were** you **doing** when the earthquake started?
* I **was listening** to my iPod, so I didn't hear the fire alarm.
* You **were not listening** to me when I told you to turn the oven off.
* While John **was sleeping** last night, someone stole his car.
* Sammy **was waiting** for us when we got off the plane.
* While I **was writing** the email, the computer suddenly went off.
*   A: What **were** you **doing** when you broke your leg?   B: I **was snowboarding** &#x20;

    .

## USE 2 Specific Time as an Interruption

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/pastcontinuous.gif)

In USE 1, described above, the Past Continuous is interrupted by a shorter action in the Simple Past. However, you can also use a specific time as an interruption.

Examples:

* Last night at 6 PM, I **was eating** dinner.
* At midnight, we **were** still **driving** through the desert.
* Yesterday at this time, I **was sitting** at my desk at work.

### IMPORTANT

In the Simple Past, a specific time is used to show when an action began or finished. In the Past Continuous, a specific time only interrupts the action.

Examples:

*   Last night at 6 PM, I **ate** dinner.

    _I started eating at 6 PM._
*   Last night at 6 PM, I **was eating** dinner.

    _I started earlier; and at 6 PM, I was in the process of eating dinner._

## USE 3 Parallel Actions

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/pastcontinuousparallel.gif)

When you use the Past Continuous with two actions in the same sentence, it expresses the idea that both actions were happening at the same time. The actions are parallel.

Examples:

* I **was studying** while he **was making** dinner.
* While Ellen **was reading**, Tim **was watching** television.
* **Were** you **listening** while he **was talking**?
* I **wasn't paying** attention while I **was writing** the letter, so I made several mistakes.
* What **were** you **doing** while you **were waiting**?
* Thomas **wasn't working**, and I **wasn't working** either.
* They **were eating** dinner, **discussing** their plans, and **having** a good time.

## USE 4 Atmosphere

In English, we often use a series of parallel actions to describe the atmosphere at a particular time in the past.

Example:

* When I walked into the office, several people **were** busily **typing**, some **were talking** on the phones, the boss **was yelling** directions, and customers **were waiting** to be helped. One customer **was yelling** at a secretary and **waving** his hands. Others **were complaining** to each other about the bad service.

## USE 5 Repetition and Irritation with "Always"

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepasthabit.gif)

The Past Continuous with words such as "always" or "constantly" expresses the idea that something irritating or shocking often happened in the past. The concept is very similar to the expression "[used to](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/usedto.html)" but with negative emotion. Remember to put the words "always" or "constantly" between "be" and "verb+ing."

Examples:

* She **was always coming** to class late.
* He **was constantly talking**. He annoyed everyone.
* I didn't like them because they **were always complaining**

## While vs. When

Clauses are groups of words which have meaning, but are often not complete sentences. Some clauses begin with the word "when" such as "when she called" or "when it bit me." Other clauses begin with "while" such as "while she was sleeping" and "while he was surfing." When you talk about things in the past, "when" is most often followed by the verb tense [Simple Past](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplepast.html), whereas "while" is usually followed by Past Continuous. "While" expresses the idea of "during that time." Study the examples below. They have similar meanings, but they emphasize different parts of the sentence.

Examples:

* I was studying **when she called**.
* **While I was studying**, she called.

## REMEMBER Non-Continuous Verbs / Mixed Verbs

It is important to remember that [Non-Continuous Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html) cannot be used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for [Mixed Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html) cannot be used in continuous tenses. Instead of using Past Continuous with these verbs, you must use [Simple Past](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/simplepast.html).

Examples:

* Jane **was being** at my house when you arrived. _Not Correct_
* Jane **was** at my house when you arrived. _Correct_

## ADVERB PLACEMENT

The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.

Examples:

* You were **just** studying when she called.
* Were you **just** studying when she called?

## ACTIVE / PASSIVE

Examples:

* The salesman **was helping** the customer when the thief came into the store. _Active_
* The customer **was being helped** by the salesman when the thief came into the store. _Passive_

# SECTION B3

**FORM: \[had + past participle]**

Examples:

* You **had studied** English before you moved to New York.
* **Had** you **studied** English before you moved to New York?
* You **had** not **studied** English before you moved to New York.

## USE 1 Completed Action Before Something in the Past

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/pastperfect.gif)

The Past Perfect expresses the idea that something occurred before another action in the past. It can also show that something happened before a specific time in the past.

Examples:

* I **had** never **seen** such a beautiful beach before I went to Kauai.
* I did not have any money because I **had lost** my wallet.
* Tony knew Istanbul so well because he **had visited** the city several times.
* **Had** Susan ever **studied** Thai before she moved to Thailand?
* She only understood the movie because she **had read** the book.
* Kristine **had** never **been** to an opera before last night.
* We were not able to get a hotel room because we **had not booked** in advance.
* A: **Had** you ever **visited** the U.S. before your trip in 2006?    B: Yes, I **had been** to the U.S. once before.

## USE 2 Duration Before Something in the Past (Non-Continuous Verbs)

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/pastperfectcontinuous.gif)

With [Non-Continuous Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html) and some non-continuous uses of [Mixed Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html), we use the Past Perfect to show that something started in the past and continued up until another action in the past.

Examples:

* We **had had** that car for ten years before it broke down.
* By the time Alex finished his studies, he **had been** in London for over eight years.
* They felt bad about selling the house because they **had owned** it for more than forty years.

Although the above use of Past Perfect is normally limited to Non-Continuous Verbs and non-continuous uses of Mixed Verbs, the words "live," "work," "teach," and "study" are sometimes used in this way even though they are NOT Non-Continuous Verbs.

## IMPORTANT Specific Times with the Past Perfect

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/simplepastspecific.gif)

Unlike with the [Present Perfect](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/presentperfect.html), it is possible to use specific time words or phrases with the Past Perfect. Although this is possible, it is usually not necessary.

Example:

She **had visited** her Japanese relatives once in 1993 before she moved in with them in 1996.

### MOREOVER

If the Past Perfect action did occur at a specific time, the Simple Past can be used instead of the Past Perfect when "before" or "after" is used in the sentence. The words "before" and "after" actually tell you what happens first, so the Past Perfect is optional. For this reason, both sentences below are correct.

Examples:

* She **had visited** her Japanese relatives once in 1993 before she moved in with them in 1996.
* She **visited** her Japanese relatives once in 1993 before she moved in with them in 1996.

### HOWEVER

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/pastperfect.gif)

If the Past Perfect is not referring to an action at a specific time, Past Perfect is not optional. Compare the examples below. Here Past Perfect is referring to a lack of experience rather than an action at a specific time. For this reason, Simple Past cannot be used.

Examples:

* She never **saw** a bear before she moved to Alaska. _Not Correct_
* She **had** never **seen** a bear before she moved to Alaska. _Correct_

## ADVERB PLACEMENT

The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.

Examples:

* You had **previously** studied English before you moved to New York.
* Had you **previously** studied English before you moved to New York?

## ACTIVE / PASSIVE

Examples:

* George **had repaired** many cars before he received his mechanic's license. _Active_
* Many cars **had been repaired** by George before he received his mechanic's license. _Passive_

# SECTION B4

**FORM: \[had been + present participle]**

Examples:

* You **had been waiting** there for more than two hours when she finally arrived.
* **Had** you **been waiting** there for more than two hours when she finally arrived?
* You **had not been waiting** there for more than two hours when she finally arrived.

## USE 1 Duration Before Something in the Past

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/pastperfectcontinuous.gif)

We use the Past Perfect Continuous to show that something started in the past and continued up until another time in the past. "For five minutes" and "for two weeks" are both durations which can be used with the Past Perfect Continuous. Notice that this is related to the [Present Perfect Continuous](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/presentperfectcontinuous.html); however, the duration does not continue until now, it stops before something else in the past.

Examples:

* They **had been talking** for over an hour before Tony arrived.
* She **had been working** at that company for three years when it went out of business.
* How long **had** you **been waiting** to get on the bus?
* Mike wanted to sit down because he **had been standing** all day at work.
* James **had been teaching** at the university for more than a year before he left for Asia.
* A: How long **had** you**been studying** Turkish before you moved to Ankara?   B: I **had not been studying** Turkish very long.

## USE 2 Cause of Something in the Past

![](http://www.englishpage.com/image/verbs/pastperfectcontinuous.gif)

Using the Past Perfect Continuous before another action in the past is a good way to show cause and effect.

Examples:

* Jason was tired because he **had been jogging**.
* Sam gained weight because he **had been overeating**.
* Betty failed the final test because she **had not been attending** class.

## Past Continuous vs. Past Perfect Continuous

If you do not include a duration such as "for five minutes," "for two weeks" or "since Friday," many English speakers choose to use the Past Continuous rather than the Past Perfect Continuous. Be careful because this can change the meaning of the sentence. Past Continuous emphasizes interrupted actions, whereas Past Perfect Continuous emphasizes a duration of time before something in the past. Study the examples below to understand the difference.

Examples:

*   He was tired because he **was exercising** so hard.

    _This sentence emphasizes that he was tired because he was exercising at that exact moment._
*   He was tired because he**had been exercising** so hard.

    _This sentence emphasizes that he was tired because he had been exercising over a period of time. It is possible that he was still exercising at that moment OR that he had just finished._

## REMEMBER Non-Continuous Verbs / Mixed Verbs

It is important to remember that [Non-Continuous Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html) cannot be used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for [Mixed Verbs](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/types.html) cannot be used in continuous tenses. Instead of using Past Perfect Continuous with these verbs, you must use [Past Perfect](http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/pastperfect.html).

Examples:

* The motorcycle **had been belonging** to George for years before Tina bought it. _Not Correct_
* The motorcycle **had belonged** to George for years before Tina bought it. _Correct_

## ADVERB PLACEMENT

The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.

Examples:

* You had **only** been waiting there for a few minutes when she arrived.
* Had you **only** been waiting there for a few minutes when she arrived?

## ACTIVE / PASSIVE

Examples:

* Chef Jones **had been preparing** the restaurant's fantastic dinners for two years before he moved to Paris. _Active_
* The restaurant's fantastic dinners **had been being prepared** by Chef Jones for two years before he moved to Paris. _Passive_

NOTE: Passive forms of the Past Perfect Continuous are not common.

# SECTION B review PAST

## Simple Past

## Most Verbs

Most verbs conjugate by adding _-ed_ like the verb "wait" below.

| Positive         | Negative               | Question               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| I **waited**.    | I **did not wait**.    | **Did** I **wait**?    |
| You **waited**.  | You **did not wait**.  | **Did** you **wait**?  |
| We **waited**.   | We **did not wait**.   | **Did** we **wait**?   |
| They **waited**. | They **did not wait**. | **Did** they **wait**? |
| He **waited**.   | He **did not wait**.   | **Did** he **wait**?   |
| She **waited**.  | She **did not wait**.  | **Did** she **wait**?  |
| It **waited**.   | It **did not wait**.   | **Did** it **wait**?   |

## Irregular Verbs

Many verbs, such as "have," take irregular forms in the Simple Past. Notice that you only use the irregular verbs in statements. In negative forms and questions, "did" indicates Simple Past. To learn more about irregular verbs, visit [Englishpage.com's Irregular Verb Dictionary](http://www.englishpage.com/irregularverbs/irregularverbs.html). You can also use [Englishpage.com's Online Irregular Verb Flashcards](http://www.englishpage.com/irregularverbs/irregular\_verb\_flashcards.html) to memorize irregular verb forms.

| Positive      | Negative               | Question               |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| I **had**.    | I **did not have**.    | **Did** I **have**?    |
| You **had**.  | You **did not have**.  | **Did** you **have**?  |
| We **had**.   | We **did not have**.   | **Did** we **have**?   |
| They **had**. | They **did not have**. | **Did** they **have**? |
| He **had**.   | He **did not have**.   | **Did** he **have**?   |
| She **had**.  | She **did not have**.  | **Did** she **have**?  |
| It **had**.   | It **did not have**.   | **Did** it **have**?   |

## To Be

The verb "be" is also irregular in the Simple Past. Unlike other irregular verbs, there are two Simple Past forms: "was" and "were." It also has different question forms and negative forms. Always remember that you DO NOT use "did" with the verb "be" in the Simple Past.

| Positive       | Negative           | Question       |
| -------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| I **was**.     | I **was not**.     | **Was** I?     |
| You **were**.  | You **were not**.  | **Were** you?  |
| We **were**.   | We **were not**.   | **Were** we?   |
| They **were**. | They **were not**. | **Were** they? |
| He **was**.    | He **was not**.    | **Was** he?    |
| She **was**.   | She **was not**.   | **Was** she?   |
| It **was**.    | It **was not**.    | **Was** it?    |

## Modal Verbs

Modal verbs behave very strangely in the Simple Past. The most important verb to remember is "must." Notice how it becomes "had to" in the Simple Past.

"Must" becomes "had to":

* I **must** call my wife now.
* I **had to** call my wife yesterday.

## Past Continuous

| Positive               | Negative                   | Question                   |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| I **was singing**.     | I **was not singing**.     | **Was** I **singing**?     |
| You **were singing**   | You **were not singing**.  | **Were** you **singing**?  |
| We **were singing**.   | We **were not singing**.   | **Were** we **singing**?   |
| They **were singing**. | They **were not singing**. | **Were** they **singing**? |
| He **was singing**.    | He **was not singing**.    | **Was** he **singing**?    |
| She **was singing**.   | She **was not singing**.   | **Was** she **singing**?   |
| It **was singing**.    | It **was not singing**.    | **Was** it **singing**?    |

## Past Perfect

| Positive               | Negative                   | Question                   |

| I **had finished**.    | I **had not finished**.    | **Had** I **finished**?    |
| You **had finished**.  | You **had not finished**.  | **Had** you **finished**?  |
| We **had finished**.   | We **had not finished**.   | **Had** we **finished**?   |
| They **had finished**. | They **had not finished**. | **Had** they **finished**? |
| He **had finished**.   | He **had not finished**.   | **Had** he **finished**?   |
| She **had finished**.  | She **had not finished**.  | **Had** she **finished**?  |
| It **had finished**.   | It **had not finished**.   | **Had** it **finished**?   |

## Past Perfect Continuous

| Positive                     | Negative                        | Question                         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| I **had been listening**.    | I **had not been listening**.   | **Had** I **been listening**?    |

| She **had been listening**.  | She **had not been listening**. | **Had** she **been listening**?  |
| It **had been listening**.   | It **had not been listening**.  | **Had** it **been listening**?   |
